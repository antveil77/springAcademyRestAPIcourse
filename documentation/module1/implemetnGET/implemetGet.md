# Implement GET

## REST, CRUD, and HTTP  

REST: Representational State Transfer. 
In a RESTful system, data objects are called Resource Representations. 
The purpose of a RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is to manage the state of these Resources.

Said another way, you can think of “state” being “value” and “Resource Representation” being an “object” or "thing".
